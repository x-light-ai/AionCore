//! HTTP routes for the ai-agent crate, grouped by capability.
//!
//! - [`agent`] — agent-registry endpoints (`/api/agents*`).
//! - [`acp_probe`] — ACP CLI probe endpoints (`/api/acp/*`).
//! - [`session_ops`] — endpoints that dispatch on the concrete
//!   [`AgentInstance`](crate::agent_task::AgentInstance) variant
//!   (mode / model / config / usage / agent-capabilities /
//!   openclaw-runtime / side-question / slash-commands).
//! - [`conversation_ops`] — endpoints that do **not** need agent-type
//!   dispatch (workspace / reload-context).
//!
//! The conversation-scoped routers share [`SessionRouterState`] so the
//! caller only has to construct one state object.
