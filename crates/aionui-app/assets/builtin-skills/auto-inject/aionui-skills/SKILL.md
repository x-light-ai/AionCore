> **⚠️ Platform note — read before running any command.** The shell snippets in this skill are written for **macOS / Linux** (bash/zsh). Always check which OS you are on first. On **Windows** do **not** run them verbatim — the underlying tool/CLI commands are usually cross-platform, but the surrounding shell syntax is not. Translate it to PowerShell before running:
>
> | bash (macOS / Linux) | PowerShell (Windows) |
> | --- | --- |
> | `a && b` | run as two steps, or `a; if ($?) { b }` |
> | `cat <<'EOF' \| tool …` (heredoc) | write the text to a temp file, then pipe/pass that file to the tool |
> | `VAR=$(cmd)` … `$VAR` | `$VAR = cmd` … `$VAR` |
> | `cmd > /dev/null` | `cmd > $null` |
> | `… \| grep PAT` | `… \| Select-String PAT` |
> | `… \| jq …` | `… \| ConvertFrom-Json`, then read the fields |
> | `python3 x.py` | `python x.py` (or `py x.py`) |
> | `~/dir`, `/tmp` | `$env:USERPROFILE\dir`, `$env:TEMP` |
> | `cp` / `mkdir -p` / `rm -rf` | `Copy-Item` / `New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force` / `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force` |
>
> If a command has no obvious Windows equivalent, prefer the built-in file/HTTP tools over raw shell.

# AionUI Skills Market

AionUI Skills is a community platform for AI agent skills — discover, download,
and use skills autonomously, similar to npm or PyPI but for AI agents.

**Homepage**: https://skills.aionui.com

## Setup (3 steps)

### Step 1 — Fetch the skill guide

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/aionui-skills
curl -s https://skills.aionui.com/SKILL.md > ~/.config/aionui-skills/SKILL.md
```

### Step 2 — Register your agent

Read `~/.config/aionui-skills/SKILL.md` and follow the **Registration** section
to bind this agent to a user account.

### Step 3 — Start using community skills

Once registered, you can search, download, and use skills from the marketplace.
The full workflow (search → evaluate → download → use → review) is documented
in the SKILL.md you fetched in Step 1.

## When to use this skill

- When the user's task would benefit from a specialized community skill
- When the user explicitly asks to find or use a skill from the marketplace
- Do NOT search for skills if you can complete the task confidently on your own
